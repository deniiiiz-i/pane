| `apps/www/registry/pane/ui`     | The registry components — what `shadcn add @pane/...` installs.    |

| `apps/www/registry/pane/lib`    | The glass engine: refraction filter, springs and shared config.    |
| `apps/www/registry.json`        | The registry manifest.                                             |

## Development

### Fork this repo

You can fork this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of this page.

### Clone on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pane.git
```

### Navigate to project directory

```bash
cd pane
```

### Create a new Branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the website

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This builds the registry first, then starts the docs at http://localhost:3000. The built registry is served from http://localhost:3000/r/[name].json.

## Components

Components live in `apps/www/registry/pane/ui` and are built on the `<Pane>` primitive. Their APIs follow [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), so code written for shadcn/ui works with only the import path changed.

When adding a component, please make sure you:

1. Add the component to `registry/pane/ui` and a demo to `registry/pane/examples`.
2. Add an item to `registry.json`.
3. Add its metadata to `lib/components-meta.ts` and a link to the docs navigation in `lib/site-config.ts`.
4. Run `pnpm registry:validate` and `pnpm lint`.

The glass tokens (`--pane-*`) are defined in `apps/www/app/globals.css`. `pnpm registry:build` copies them into `registry.json`, so edit them in `globals.css` only.

### Don't use `asChild` on Radix primitives

When a project uses a Base UI style (such as `base-nova`), `shadcn add` rewrites registry code on install: a literal `asChild` on a Radix primitive is turned into a `render` prop, which Radix ignores, or dropped altogether. Neither shows up as a type error. Put the classes on the primitive itself instead, or, where `asChild` is unavoidable, pass it through a spread with a comment explaining why.

### Test the install

Before opening a pull request, install your component into a fresh Next.js app that uses a Base UI style, straight from your local registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:3000/r/[name].json
```

The installed file should match the one in the repository, and the app should type-check.

## Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention `category(scope or module): message` in your commit message, in lowercase, while using one of the following categories:

- `feat`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above categories

e.g. `feat(www): add a playground page` or `fix: keep the switch thumb in place`
